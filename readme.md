# jBudget - Democratizing financial decision making
First experiment with sinatra. A lean Sinatra web app for crowdsourcing 
financial decisions.

HOWTO:
* Run ruby vote.rb to run the server
* Delete the yaml file (votes.yml) to restart the voting

Technologies used:
* Sinatra for a ruby based backend with a yaml file as a data storage
* jQuery
* Bootstrap for look and feel
* D3.js for visualization (using NvD3 library)
